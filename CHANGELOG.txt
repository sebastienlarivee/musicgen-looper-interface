Version 0.2.0 (December 20 2023):
Complete code rewrite:
- All the inference code is now in 'generate.py'.
- 4 main inference functions (only 2 are implemented in Gradio in this release).
- Gradio interface now has two different "endpoints" for text to loop and audio to loop.
- New file 'globals.py' which handles model loading and save path operations.
- Code is generally much cleaner and readable (I hope!) and should speed up future development.

Interface update:
- Tabs for text to loop and audio to loop.
- Removed output file type option from 'settings', now defaults to .wav

Other changes/notes:
- Renamed 'requirements.txt' to 'requirements_colab.txt' as that's more accurate.
- Added 'CHANGELOG.txt'
- I currently don't know the full install requirements for this project as I can't run it locally.

Version 0.1.1 (December 14 2023):
I made some small changes to the initial release. I don't remeber what they were but I'll mention it in this doc for completeness.
