# MusicGen Looper Interface
Gradio implementation of [Cog MusicGen Looper](https://github.com/andreasjansson/cog-musicgen-looper) by Andreas Jansson. Uses MusicGen to generate music samples then trims them into seemless loops, and can generate multiple self-consistent variations based on the first audio generated.

# Run on Colab
A simple colab notebook can be found [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cGaPjpETt0eBr1RPXhu3SvWoh1AaZN-I?usp=sharing) and should provide everything you need get started with the interface.
